# 🚀 Quantum Computing Deadline

Welcome to the **Quantum Computing Hub**, your one-stop destination for keeping track of the latest deadlines for top qc conferences, journals, and workshops! 📅✨

## 🚀 Adding/updating a conference

Want to contribute? Awesome! Here’s how:

* Read the data format description below. **Note that the timezone format sign is inverted** (e.g., UTC+7 is written as `Etc/GMT-7`). It's [not a bug][0]. Yeah, we know—it’s weird. If you have a better JavaScript timezone library in mind, hit us up! 😅
* Update `_data/conferences.yml`. You can do this directly on GitHub or locally after forking the repo.
* Send a pull request. 🎉

### ✅ Is my entry in scope?
